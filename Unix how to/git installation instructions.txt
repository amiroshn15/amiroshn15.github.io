1)Install git together with "git bash"

2) Create a (regular) folder containing all projects (say repos or projects)

3) Add a public key in bitbucket (account/viewprofile/ssh setting) from .ssh folder
typically a key will be in id_rsa.pub. One can create a new key (use ssh programto generate a key).

See: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/creating-ssh-keys-776639788.html

4) go to bitbucket and find "clone" button which will provide with the command line to run

5) if publik key is not found then rename the keys in .ssh folder as follows:
git_rsa to id_rsa and git_ersa.pub into id_rsa.pub

6) git has to be configured:

git config --global user.email "amiroshn@attlasian.com"

useful commands:

git checkout evgeny/iter #to change branches:

git add filename # add file
git commit -m "message"
git push 
git pull
